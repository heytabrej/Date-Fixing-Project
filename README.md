## Project Overview

This project consists of two HTML files (\`index.html\` and \`date.html\`) and an associated CSS file (\`style.css\`). The HTML files contain charming invitation messages, cute animated illustrations, and interactive buttons. The JavaScript functions add interactivity to the buttons, redirecting to new pages and, in the case of the "Let's Fix a Date" button, opening Google Calendar with predefined event details.



## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone 
   \`\`\`

2. Open the \`index.html\` or \`yes.html\` file in a web browser.

3. Interact with the buttons to respond to invitations or fix a date on Google Calendar.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the content, styling, and functionality to suit your preferences. Modify the HTML and CSS files to add your own messages, change colors, or update the animations.
